# Plant-Detection using YOLOn11
A deep learning-based computer vision project to detect and classify plant species using the YOLOv8 model. The model was trained on a custom Roboflow dataset with the aim of accurately detecting common indoor plants.

This project was created as part of a club initiative to experiment with object detection models and custom datasets.
# Dataset
Source: Dataset- https://universe.roboflow.com/krishna-1l7vd/plant-detection-926d9/dataset/1

Format: YOLOv8

Version: 1

Classes:

Tulsi

Money Plant

Aloe Vera

Rattlesnake Plant

Begonia

ðŸ‘‰ Annotations were carefully prepared. Some classes such as Aloe Vera required improved augmentation strategies due to slightly lower detection scores.
